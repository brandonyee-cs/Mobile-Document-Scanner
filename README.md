# Mobile-Document-Scanner

This code references Pyimagesearch's ["How to Build a Kick-Ass Mobile Document Scanner in Just 5 Minutes"](https://pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/01/build-kick-ass-mobile-document-scanner-just-5-minutes/) tutorial.


# Features

 - Utilizes Pyimagesearch's transform library (four_point_transformation function)

 - Detects Edges and warps image as if it were scanned in view a printer.

 # To Be Added

 - I plan on adding a OCR function to not only scan documents but then detect the text it contains.
